Write a program that computes and displays the charges for patient hospital stay. First, the program should ask if the patient was admitted as an in-patient or an out patient. If the patient was an in-patient, the follow data should be entered: the number of days spent in the hospital, the daily rate, hospital medication charges, charges for hospital services. The program should ask for the following data if the patient was an out-patient: charges for hospital services, hospital medication charges. The program should use two overload functions to calculate the total charges. One of the functions should accept arguments for the in-patient data, while the other function accept arguments for out patient information, both functions should return the total charges. Input validation: Do not accept negative numbers for any data.
